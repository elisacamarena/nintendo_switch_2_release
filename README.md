#Final project - Applied Econometrics II
## Nintendo Switch 2 release
\
\
This repository is the final project for my Applied Econometrics II class.
The main purpose of the project is to build a well-documented data scraping pipeline to extract comments from YouTube using the Youtube Data API. 
\
\
I will be extracting comments from the Nintendo Switch 2 release video to build a database which I will then clasify into "positive" and "negative" usign TextBlob, a natural language processing (NLP) library.
