# Final project - Applied Econometrics II
## Nintendo Switch 2 release
\
:video_game: This repository is the final project for my Applied Econometrics II class.
The main purpose of the project is to build a well-documented data scraping pipeline to extract comments from YouTube using the Youtube Data API. 
\
\
The code extracts comments from the Nintendo Switch 2 release video to build a database and then classifies them into "positive" and "negative" usign TextBlob, a natural language processing (NLP) library. Finally, it graphs the results and shows the sentiment distribution.
