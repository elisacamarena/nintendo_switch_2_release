## Nintendo Switch 2 release
\

This repository is the final project for my Applied Econometrics II class.
The main purpose of the project is to build a well-documented data scraping pipeline to extract comments from YouTube using the Youtube Data API.

I will be extracting comments from the Nintendo Switch 2 release video to build a database which I will then clasify into "positive", "neutral" and "negative" usign Hugging Face language processing model.
