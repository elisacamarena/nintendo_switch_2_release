@tiootte5,"so far all im seeing is nintendo switch expansion.....like  a 1.5 upgrade not a full 2.....

still my fav system...nintendo
cant beat super mario karts from super nintedo.....coming from a guy in his 30's"
@Codyisfake,the only way you will see me buying this is if it has roblox on it... (JUST ADD ROBLOX ALREADY NINTENDO YOUR SALES WOULD GO UP 100 TIMES WHAT THEY ARE NOW)
@Kingsnipe-vj8ft,Dear nintendo of america! I have made my way into this video to ask something.. WHEN WILL YOU SUPPORT STEAM (and roblox)
@JaymielHarris,What would the new system be called Switch 3 lets see what the future holds
@giovanniperez7787,I want that system I mean I have a Nintendo Switch but this one is cooler.
@EuroBlob,Price of games need to go down to 60 or 70. Anything more and I'm keeping my money.

@robertzombiekill6365,"Yeah The $450 Pricetag for the system & $90 game pricetag is WAY TOO MUCH. I hesitated to even buy the latest Zelda due to the Pricetag, but this is just CRAZY. They can keep it unless they reduce prices significantly, my Nintendo Switch (1) works just fine & I don't play it that often anyway. üá∫üá≤"

@LeoJthe747,"It honestly is sad, 450 for a console you get a license to use (nintendo fan boys its not misinformation, look at article 1 section 1 and 2 of the Switch end user agreement) and 80 dollars for a license to play a game. With taxes and shipping 500 and 90 dollars come out of your pocket for each, and at that point, I would switch consoles, as it looks more reliable in the long run, remeber, after the next console comes out, nintendo wont hesitate to shut down the e shop and servers for the previous consoles, just like they did with the 2ds and 3ds."
@Nicole-kr6tn,"Even if Nintendo straightens up their act I'll never buy anything from them again. 
Their lawsuits, and bullying of other gaming companies and *individuals* is morally reprehensible. 
This is how you kill the multi-headed beast, you stop feeding all the heads. 
If you love video games, VOTE. WITH. YOUR. WALLET. 
Don't buy the Switch 2, which Nintendo has straight up said you won't own even if you buy, and that modifying it in any way will lead them to REMOTELY BRICK YOUR SYSTEM. Don't buy the over priced games. Cancel subscriptions. 
If you really want your Pok√©mon fix buy it second hand so Nintendo doesn't get any money from your personal transaction. 
Find a second hand Game Shop to buy older consoles and games, but for the love of god do not buy anything modern from them. 

This obviously is just my advice, no one has to take it if they don't want to. But know that if you support Nintendo monetarily you are supporting the death of creativity in gaming. 
Humanity would not be where it is today without building off of the ideas of our predecessors, all the way from the invention of the wheel to right now. Everything we use, every technique, every machine, every sentence we speak, every story we listen to- all of it built off of an idea that came before. 

They can't force us to purchase their products, they're hoping that people will just keep supporting them because of their successful IPs, despite being awful human beings."

Also big question; what happens when a person did not add anything to their switch2 nor mod it.

That you now own All there nintemdo merchandise and if they even think about doing anything ti it you can sue them 



That you can‚Äôt be sued for anything but you can sue people fir anything 





That they can only play Nintendo made games on your new switch and that anything that Isent made by Nintendo will crash there systems 




That once they complete a game no mater how much there progress is they get there game deleted from the switch and have to white 2 months just to play that game again 





That players can‚Äôt even complain about glutches and report them or you‚Äôll brick there system 





That fact that it is now illegal to make there own fan Pok√©mon games and they can be charged 89 million dollars for it

@Man_From_The_Desert,"I think i know how to make a console Impossible to hack, no cap."
@1982mdunc,Your games perform horribly on the switch lite. Furthermore your games are so poorly coded that it is literally impossible at times to complete an objective. E.g. Zelda TOTK a falling star lands on a cliff but as soon as you get within 50 yards it either disappears or falls into the water. No amount of using abilities addresses this poorly coded function.

@TheHellfiend,"Nah, between attacking content creators who are only trying to generate hype for their games, attacking fan game creators, saying they can now brick your device if they ""think"" you are misusing the hardware. Heck, even the Palworld situation... Would Pok√©mon even be a thing if Chunsoft and Enix had copywritten turn-based battle systems when Dragon Warrior came out in '86?

Not denying that they can develop great games, but that doesn't excuse the anti everyone but Nintendo philosophy they are running the business under these past few decades. Last system I bought was the GC. Got a Wii and Wii U second hand and still play those due to the games, but Nintendo is never getting any of my cash again..... maybe if they ""switch"" to being a third party developer and quit taking everyone and their dog to court.

That said, if you wanna buy their system and games, more power to you! I'm sure you'll have fun and those first party titles will be great."

Gamers in 2025 won‚Äôt fall for this. We‚Äôre more selective now, and this kind of outdated, anti-consumer move won‚Äôt go unnoticed.

@AvidDevar,"Dear Nintendo, Stop wasting your time.  Until 2 years ago I would‚Äôve advocated for anyone wanting to play games or new to games to start with a Nintendo system.  However, this new price change you are attempting is inexcusable and morally bankrupt.  To say nothing of your unethical and immoral lawsuit against PalWorld which would not and did not compete with your market.  People who are Pok√©mon fans would‚Äôve and did for the most part still purchase your products.  However, I find myself steadily pushed towards an uncomfortable reality where my money speaks louder than my words.  Stop messing with PalWorld and Stop trying to change the economics of gaming.  If you wanted to win over people to your customer base, you are failing miserably.  I am struggling with the idea of supporting any games you create, products you put out, or even by word of mouth supporting you anymore.  Drop your prices, drop your lawsuit, and instead of trying to claim you own the intellectual property of throwing a ball in a video game, prove Pok√©mon is and can be superior as a product by making your games better than PalWorld.  If you refuse to change what you are doing, mark my words:  You are forcing your customers to choose between you and the little guy.  In the U.S.A. Everyone wants the little guy to succeed, so your biggest market will see you as the bad guy and we don‚Äôt like bad guys in the U.S.  Most of all, the little guy is still pricing their game at $50, meaning that you have now caused them to undercut your prices, and you haven‚Äôt stopped any competition, if anything this lawsuit will make them stronger.  So I repeat Stop before it is too late.  - I‚Äôve been a Pok√©mon fan since 1996 guys.  If you were truly smart, instead of suing PalWorld, you would partner with them and together make more money than either is capable of alone."

@zachfernandez92,"People are exaggerating the prices and have the wrong information. Matio Kart is $80 not $90. The U.S. games are cheaper. And it's NOT from President Trump that the prices are $80. Nintendo said it themselves. And Nintendo made games have been confirmed to be on the cartridge. It's some third party games that might not be on the cartridge. I am not a rich guy and the games are a little high. But I am still going to try to get the Switch 2 and it's stupid to act immature about the price. Yet those people never complain about Playstation's prices of there systems, controllers and games."

@TarenWright,"Dear Nintendo,

The Steam Deck is better. Drop game prices to convince PC gamers to not just buy the same thing but it plays their Steam library of games they already own for PC and runs linux as well. Also, I know you guys at nintendo hate this but the Steam Deck is probably powerful enough to emulate switch 2 games (not that I would.) Finally, I'm still working my way through the Switch 1 library so I don't se why I should buy a $450 Switch 2 and pay $90 for every game when I have a perfect Switch 1 with a bunch of games I already own. If you want people to buy it, lower the prices. This advice is free and I know a thing or two about gamers (I am one) so you can take it and make a bunch of money or not and watch your console flop.

Sincerely,
The person who plays Wii U in 2025"

@Chi_Rho-12,We got another Wii U situation right here. Nintendo never learns from their past. They are successful and with their newfound confidence they become greedy and try and charge higher prices only for the console to inevitably fail for that reason. I actually don‚Äôt mind the console price. The game prices are what disgusts me however. The switch 1 was popular because it was convenient and affordable but the switch 2 destroys that with the prices. I‚Äôll be sticking with my switch 1 and PS5.

@TOMMYDACOMMIE,"Besides the exclusives i think ill just stick to my switch and xbox for awhile. Im glad Nintendo finally not just joined but closed the gap on console/PC games. But the console wars are over and people are just going to stick with whatever libraries they have. This is more of an upgrade which is fine because as a whole i think gaming has reached a peak especially with cross play games allowing keyboard and mouse on console. Play any game any way you want on whatever system with the best graphics or frame rate. Who won the console war? 6 way tie between PC, Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, mobile phones, and VR. They all have basically cemented digital and physical libraries for generations to come, they are basically like countries considering how much money they make. It's a bittersweet feeling but the accessibility from each device now is good for us the consumer because we all can play and chat together and whoever we'd like. Plenty of things to improve upon but in terms of accessibility literally thousands of titles are now replayable and we are spoiled with what we have. Enjoy it. Buy a steering wheel and play forza like real pit driver. Or get and old arcade stick and play pac man or metal slug exactly how it was intended. Keyboard and mouse, flight sticks, live streaming, 4k movies and music and discord on most devices makes this th gaming equilibrium moment in history."

And what's with dropping back to an LCD screen! What to wait a year and get early adopters to have to replace their console with an OLED model?!?! Thus really looks like Nintendo think their customer bass are sheep to fleece for everything they can.

@juiceala,"I'm gonna go ahead and say this, it's been bugging me since rumors about the Switch 2 having a mouse mode started showing up... I feel mouse controls are a big downgrade from the Wii pointer controls, on Wii you had both a mouse and a controller simultaneously which allowed for controls that cannot be replicated on anything, not even on PC, and you didn't even need a table or a desk to use it, you can play with pointer controls standing up, sitting down, table, no table, and you could even do multiplayer with it."

@wannabe-556,"For anyone interested in the compute power of a switch 2:

Performance Estimates (in TFlops)

The GPU in the T239 is rumored to have 1280 CUDA cores.

Clock speed estimates suggest around 1 GHz (could vary for handheld vs. docked).

Using the formula:

TFlops = (CUDA cores √ó 2 √ó clock speed in GHz) / 1000

TFlops ‚âà (1280 √ó 2 √ó 1.0) / 1000 = ~2.56 TFlops

In comparison:

Original Nintendo Switch (Tegra X1): ~0.39 TFlops (undocked)

PS4: ~1.84 TFlops

Xbox Series S: ~4 TFlops

So, the Tegra T239 is expected to be:

~6x more powerful than the original Switch

More powerful than a PS4, but less than an Xbox Series S

With DLSS, it can upscale to 4K, making visuals competitive despite raw TFLOP limitations"

@JikeWimblik,"pure speculation but with a few die shrinks on a 1.6nm could you not have a switch 2 VR with roughly the same specs as the switch but more processing demand during battery use. With all that effort that will be put into switch 2 games it certainly might be appealing for that development community to also do vr as an extra income stream.
By the way old remakes should have a value for money and quality metric to abide by this would get developers doing more with switch 2 good for new games also and enable more sellable switch 2 versions."

@stitchy408,"The Nintendo Switch 2 system can adapt to suit your situation, however you like to play. In TV mode, use the dock to play on a bigger screen. In tabletop mode, place your system however you like using the stand, and share a controller with a friend! In handheld mode, play anywhere you go. With these three play modes, you can enjoy playing whenever and wherever you want. Altogether, anytime, anywhere. Let's take a look at some features of Nintendo Switch 2 and how it's improved from the Nintendo Switch system.

At 7.9 inches, Switch 2 has a bigger built-in screen. Here's how that compares to Nintendo Switch. The system's thickness remains the same. With approximately double the pixels compared to Switch, you can enjoy games in greater detail on the 1080p screen. The screen supports up to 120 frames per second, allowing for smoother gameplay in supported titles. The LCD screen is more vivid and supports HDR, providing more contrast between light and dark areas of the images. The all new Joy-con 2 controllers connect magnetically! Strong magnets keep the controllers firmly attached to the system. Dettach a controller easily by pressing the release button on the back. The SL and SR buttons are bigger for greater comfort and control when playing with a Joy-con 2 held horizontally. The left and right sticks are now larger. 

Each Joy-con 2 controller can be used as a mouse, opening up even more ways to play in compatible games! Both the left and right Joy-con 2's support mouse controls, so you can also play certain games using two mice, like this! By adjusting the audio balance between the ranges, sounds from the built-in speakers are clearer and more natural in handheld and tabletop modes. It has a built-in microphone so you can voice chat with friends anytime via GameChat. It also uses voice cancelling technology to filter sound, so your voice will come through clearly. Even if you don't have a surround sound system, games can be enjoyed with more immersive, three-dimensional sound as if it were coming from all around you. Place your Nintendo Switch 2 however you like with a large, sturdy stand. You can move it freely, like this! 

In addition to the USB-C port found on the bottom of the system, there's one on top as well. It's handy for connecting a USB-C camera, or charging in tabletop mode. Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage, eight times that of Nintendo Switch. For storing your game downloads, save data, and more. Reading and writing data is also faster. Use the Nintendo Switch 2 dock to connect to your TV and enable up to 4K resolution for compatible games. HDR is also supported in TV mode. The Nintendo Switch 2 dock has a built-in fan that keeps your system cool, this helps keep performance stable. On Nintendo Switch 2, you can play Nintendo Switch 2 games as well as compatible Nintendo Switch games. Physical and digital games are supported."

@RealDiaFr,"Yeah I'm not paying $500 for a ""Console"" That will barely be able to run 1080p without a pixelized low frame rate screen. 
I sold my original switch not only because they forced you to pay for online that offered nothing in exchange, not even a DM to your friends option; but because the quality was so bad. Absolutely insane pixelization, the worst anti-aliasing and upscaling I've ever seen of any console ever. 
There are literally third party USB devices you can buy to use with your switch just at an attempt to apply an anti-aliasing effect to games, and people pay $100 for this.
Even games on the Nintendo SP look smoother. It's absurd."

This is in reference to the quality of games either, dropping, or being just the same but with a higher price than the previous. The console in my eyes is pretty much the same thing as the original switch except for a bigger,  screen and better rendering with the same dam joycon drift. Switch 2 exclusive games aren‚Äôt even going to be physical anymore since the cartridges are just ‚Äúkeys‚Äù to downloading the game onto your switch meaning that if they come out with another system your games can‚Äôt be moved deeming your keys worthless plastic. Paying for the chat button for a crappier version of discord, a demo game tutorial that‚Äôs behind a paywall, and a Temu quality mic is like cmon are we for real ? Overall, I‚Äôd say that the performance of Nintendo switch 2, the games, and previously mentioned crappy accessories don‚Äôt warrant their current inflated prices. There‚Äôs probably more I didn‚Äôt mention, but it‚Äôs not a stretch to say that with this many flaws others including myself are disappointed, and expected more from the 6th most wealthiest company in Japan.

Also if it is true that the switch 2 has to emulate the switch 1 gpu to make switch 1 games become compatible on the switch 2, then they have gone the hard way to make the switch 2 compatible with switch 1 games.

@puteracahyadi,don't buy and let it die slowly. prize and hidden cost are horrible. if it succeeded than all game company will do the same. so don't buy and let it die.
@anotherdayjustbreathe2063,"I would‚Äôve preferred a ps5  but theyre too expensive. 
Now that the new Switch 2  ( a far lesser console ) , is more or less the same price as a ps5; thats killed the Switch 2 for me. 

Why would anyone prefer a Switch 2 over Ps5 when theres such  a ginormous difference in quality? 
and now theyre at the same price point?

No hate to Nintendo community and I dont have a preference for ps5 community either, Im being completely impartial here.

Nintendo has a nerve. 
I feel sorry for people actually being joyful about the Switch 2 launch. 
Its unsettlingly greedy on Nintendos part.

Spec and performance wise, my old ps4 would hold up well if not better than Switch 2 üòÆ‚Äçüí® 

Sorry half ranting half shocked but Im just looking out for consumers. 
I dont like seeing people being had."

@marshallrobinson1019,"Dear Nintendo,

I'm breaking up with you.  I guess it's not me.  It's you.  You've changed.  Our relationship is finished.  It was good while it lasted.  Twenty years was a good run, but we're done.  Maybe someday, you'll understand what we had together.  I can't continue gaming with someone who's psychotic and narcissistic.  Don't call me.  I'll be offline enjoying my life."
@NoLongerUploading1,Super Awesome!
@mrdocena8082,"You know, all this sensational rumor mongering around prices, with jumping on deliberately misinformed articles, to completely misinterpreting quotes REALLY reminds me of the Wii U days...

Which means either
A) Switch 2 is going to create the ""Nintendo bubble"" again. Where the only ones still around are Nintendo fans, all-platformers, people who don't listen to rumors, and new players who heard nothing of the drama because they're desynced from social media...
Or
B) Switch 2 is going to be bought by the mass market anyways after it releases and the prices will be on full display. With many saying ""Looks like Nintendo listened to us!"" (despite the fact that people who looked up this information (aka ""shills"") have been saying this repeatedly until the release.

It's weird, but i kinda really hope for option A.
Casuals will make (Wii) or break (Wii U) the success of that era, but at least we can be away from the rumor mongers, drama kings, and clout chasers for a few years (as they'll adamantly stay out of the bubble and insult it from the sidelines for the rest of the console's existence."

@felixvalenzuela9193,"You know what Nintendo I've always thought you where such a unique gaming industry. As a kid growing up I never forgotten my dad buying me Nintendo after the Artari and the Mario game that came with it. The price was  $200 for the console and video game where no more then $20 to $30 the most. Back then it was not only affordable but unique for what it did. Now your asking $500 a console that has the power of a ps4 ability and certain game like Zelda Breath of the Wild a game I purchased $60 Dollars back then is gonna get a update to the new switch2 and it cost $90 Dollars Dude seriously. 
Nintendo im sorry to do this to you like every game like concord, Dragon Age veilguard,Assasin Shadow,The last of 2 and Suicide Squad and now Nintendo. 
I hate greedy people you shall receive the ultimate. Your company will crumble and you will be humble. Maybe there's hope unless you grow a heart but until then. I shall watch as everything you held once value will slip through your fingers and competition well rival Nintendo easily since we know your true self. Your no longer the same gaming company that was there for struggling parents. This curse of mine I pass on to thee as I saw all others before me crumble. Good luck Nintendo and remember it's not too late but then again don't be late."
@LF420-l7o,"Actually, for those who dont know...
Mario is a character created by the Japanese game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the star of the Mario franchise, a recurring character in the Donkey Kong franchise, and the mascot of the Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario is an Italian plumber who lives in the Mushroom Kingdom with his younger twin brother, Luigi. Their adventures generally involve rescuing Princess Peach from the villain Bowser while using power-ups that give them different abilities. Mario's distinctive characteristics include his large nose and mustache, overalls, red cap, and high-pitched, exaggerated Italian accent.

Mario debuted as the player character of Donkey Kong, a 1981 platform game. Miyamoto created Mario after he was unable to obtain the license to use Popeye as the protagonist. The graphical limitations of arcade hardware influenced Mario's design, such as his nose, mustache, and overalls, and he was named after Nintendo of America's landlord, Mario Segale. After Donkey Kong, Mario starred in Mario Bros. (1983). Its 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System sequel, Super Mario Bros., began the successful Super Mario platformer series. Charles Martinet voiced Mario from 1991 to 2023, when he was succeeded by Kevin Afghani.

Mario has appeared in over 200 video games. These include puzzle games such as Dr. Mario, role-playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, and sports games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis. He lacks a set personality and consistent profession, allowing him to take on many different roles across the Mario franchise. Mario is often accompanied by a large cast of supporting characters, including friends like Princess Daisy, Toad, and Yoshi and rivals like Bowser Jr., Donkey Kong, and Wario. Mario has also appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as the Super Smash Bros. series of crossover fighting games.

Mario is an established pop culture icon and is widely considered the most famous video game character in history. His likeness has been featured in merchandise, and people and places have been nicknamed after him. He inspired many video game characters, including Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, and unofficial media. The Mario franchise is the bestselling video game franchise of all time, with more than 800 million units sold worldwide. Mario has been adapted in various media; he was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the live-action film Super Mario Bros. (1993) and voiced by Chris Pratt in the animated film The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)."

After years on the Nintendo express, where 'free' seems to be a typo,  I'm tempted by a platform that doesn't make me feel like I need to rebuy my childhood. Honestly, with this update to the ""Nintendo greed policy"", maybe this Switch 2 should have been called the 'Switch U 2' ‚Äì because it's finally helping me switch to another platform or maybe its just my loyalty card that has finnaly expired??"
@MobileDecay,Don't worry Nintendo I was never gonna buy a Switch 2. You don't have to tell me twice. I'm sure rich people will love this console.
@motiefofficial3583,"Oh dear Nintendo. Have you guys not learnt from the past? Have you guys not realized these consumer unfriendly practices causes people to actively trying to bypass your stupid money making ethics? Has Steam, Netflix, Disney+, Xbox Game pass etc. not learnt you anything about people? About how people don't want to pirate, but want to have the easiest access to their entertainment for a reasonable price tag. We get it, gaming is expensive and the budgets for games are enormous yet somehow we fail to realize that indie developed games are usually the ones reigning supreme in the gaming space. You are not the only ones in the handheld space anymore.. the monopoly position is gone. Besides first party games, there is no reason to buy the console..  because indie titles and half a decade old games are readily available on hardware that costs a similar price tag, yet with fewer consumer unfriendly practices. These games go on massive sales frequently. Looking at those first party games.. I mean.. 600$+ just to play a bit of multiplayer Mario kart, take away the console and were still looking at a unjustifiable price tag for most people. There is no hiding behind Tariffs... this is pure greed. Remember the abysmal state Pok√©mon released in? just imagine that with a 90$ price tag.. You want to net more profit? make sure the games you release are decent. Remember, its better to sell 5.000.000 copies at 70$ than it is to sell 2.500.000 copies at 90$. It is even more profitable to sell the 5 million copies with a 60$ price tag."

@joelockard7174,Gotta say for every new Nintendo system I was always hype because I knew without question it was something that would be affordable and approachable. This is the first system from Nintendo ever to immediately not have me caring one bit due to its pricing.  While I can pay for it why should I? It's too expensive for me to wanna pay that kind of money. Also the morons that wanna charge 80 bucks a game is gonna bankrupt a company Soo fast it's not even funny. I'd say let's also add to not support even watching the channels on YouTube that they just give systems to. It's promoting a trend in gaming that should be allowed whatsoever. I know when this mess drops I'm not going to be watching any of it at all. I hope others do the same.

*magnetic joycon - it wasnt hard to remove the joycons on the switch, so this is pointless.

@JulyScofield-do9si,I don't like how the Nintendo Switch 2 games cost $90 pair to the Nintendo Switch games cost $59.99 I thank that really dumb In my opinion but what do you guys thank do you like the price on the Nintendo Switch 2 games or not let me know?
@davidludwig-ez3gf,You just convinced me to get an Xbox Series X
@davidludwig-ez3gf,The new DS 3D
@davidludwig-ez3gf,Drop the price
@miimiiul-m9t,Drop the price
@Gooberman-u5l,This is just pure greed. It will cost those in the U.S. $768.50 to buy the switch two and one game.
@coolguy3000realz,all it takes is either a 6x2 checkerboard palette on a pink background or the roar from any godzilla iteration and i will sell my soul to them
@repkar5828,"I have really only ever owned Nintendo products for Pok√©mon/Zelda. This time I had a plan to start branching out and play other games and really enjoy the console this time around. Now, I don't even think I'm going to be playing my 2 main games.... Guess I'm going back to MMOs, the monthly payment is officially miles cheaper than buying a switch + 80$ games. Bye Nintendo."
@user-bb2st4jl3u,Trash.
@EveryBeardHasAStory,"As someone who grew up on Nintendo since the 80s, I have to say this is single-handedly the most disgusting cash-grab I've ever seen. There is nothing, NOTHING here justifying a purchase. Nothing. To leave Nintendo fans waiting all these long years only to release the exact same handheld for that crazy of a price.. 1080p... lcd.... 256gb... I didn't realize it was 2004. This is just so unethically absurd. Anyone with any shred of dignity will refrain from handing over any money to this corrupt company. It pains me to say this, but Nintendo is essentially dead. From a company that used to revel in fun and the advancement of exactly that, to a corrupt corporate entity that will try to weasel in profits on gimmicky consoles (gamecube, wii, switch) and now this. Switch XL(2) probably costs less than $100 to manufacture. This is just disgusting. Nintendo needs to go bankrupt so that the memories of old don't get tarnished any further."
@pockettangerine-13,Bring the price down... you guys are gonna ruin gaming with the 90 dollar physical games you greedy bastards
@AbodeOfSnow96,Better to buy a steam deck rather than this overpriced device.
@thevaf2825,Did Nintendo loose the plot with the pricing?
@skylarsquid0641,Switch 3 will be out by the time I get a Switch 2.
@BobBob-vq3rb,Was wrong on my predictions
@anakinskywalker4596,256gb is absolutely nothing. You could only download ffvii rebirth and cyberpunk before becoming completely full.
@Valeug91,Drop de price
@BlueTheCubeReturns,The Nintendo Switch 2 is perfect except the prices only.
@BigNateCOMICS,"If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing"
@RobFeldbauer,"Disney also made money off of Captain Marvel, because of the hype...but just like that movie, the Switch 2 is going to let everyone down when they barely see a difference on the screen. 
Your Mario Kart today looks like N64 Mario Kart compared to all the other systems.
You also said the original Switch would hit 60 frames per second but lied about that. Is the Switch 2 going to do the same with larger games and only play certain smaller games at 60 f.p.s.?
The Switch 2 is what the original Switch should have been. Instead you used the Switch as a ""GoFundMe"" game console, disappointed everyone with the horrible build quality, raked in the money, and then changing the narrative making people be happy for the new Switch 2, when you should have given this to them in the original Switch in the 1st place.
Cheapskates!"
@maison-g4g,A Lenovo legion go is better
@EaselCat,Stealing Greedtendo games and playing them on your Steam Deck is the new black.
@davidzero87,"The problem with Nintendo is every time they are on the top they always become very cocky,  honestly I understand the economy situation but this console doesn't even have a OLED screen, drop the prices dont make the same mistake over and over"
